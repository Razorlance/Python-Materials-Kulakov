With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services, networks, and volumes. This week, we will focus on understanding Docker Compose, creating `docker-compose.yml` files, and running multi-container applications.\n","\n","## Theory\n","\n","### Docker Compose\n","Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container applications. It allows you to define and run complex applications with a single command.\n","\n","**Key Features of Docker Compose:**\n","- **Multi-Container:** Manage multiple containers as a single service.\n","- **Declarative Configuration:** Use a YAML file to define services, networks, and volumes.\n","- **Isolation:** Each service runs in a separate container, providing isolation.\n","\n","### Docker Compose File\n","A `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define the services, networks, and volumes for a multi-container application.\n","\n","**Basic Structure:**\n","- **version:** Specifies the version of the Compose file format.\n","- **services:** Defines the services that make up your application.\n","- **volumes:** Defines the shared storage volumes.\n","- **networks:** Defines custom networks for service communication.\n","\n","## Key Points\n","- Docker Compose simplifies multi-container application management.\n","- The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the configuration for your application.\n","- Services, networks, and volumes are the main components of a Compose file.\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ERzMc4mWA9La"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Code and Examples\n","\n","### Creating a Docker Compose File\n","\n","**Example `docker-compose.yml` File:**\n","```yaml\n","version: '3'\n","services:\n","  web:\n","    image: my-python-app\n","    build: .\n","    ports:\n","      - \"4000:80\"\n","    depends_on:\n","      - redis\n","  redis:\n","    image: \"redis:alpine\"\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yaYn0-kTBF0Z"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Explanation:\n","\n","* **version:** Specifies the Compose file format version.\n","* **services:** Defines two services: web and redis.\n","* **web:** Uses the my-python-app image, builds the image if needed, maps port 4000 on the host to port 80 in the container, and specifies that it depends on the redis service.\n","* **redis:** Uses the redis:alpine image."],"metadata":{"id":"ZsUyrw5rBNEn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Running Docker Compose\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bXWike71Bh29"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","```\n","# Start the application\n","docker-compose up\n","```\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"V2FmNw9FBjq8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["*Example Usage:* Use docker-compose up to start all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
